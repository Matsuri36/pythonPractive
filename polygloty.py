# Each of a certain set of schoolchildren of a certain school knows a certain number of languages. 
# It is necessary to determine how many languages ​​all students know, and how many languages ​​at least one of the students knows.

# The first line contains the number of students. For each of the students, first the number of languages ​​that he 
# knows is written down, and then the names of the languages, one per line.

# In the first line print the number of languages ​​that all students know. Starting from the second line - a list of such languages. 
# Then - the number of languages ​​that at least one student knows, on the next lines - a list of such languages. 
# Languages ​​should be output in lexicographical order, one per line.
